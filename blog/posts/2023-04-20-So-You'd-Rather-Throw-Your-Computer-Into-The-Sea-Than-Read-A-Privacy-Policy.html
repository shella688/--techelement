            <p>
              If you've fallen prey to the siren call of clicking the little I Have 
              Read The Terms And Conditions checkbox without ever actually reading 
              the thing, you're not alone. Everyone does it. Hell, I've done it. Those 
              things are long, with small text and terrible wording - all of which 
              is often done deliberately. Nevertheless it's important to know what 
              a given service is doing with the data you provide it, and so this 
              guide aims to give a rundown of ways to make reading a privacy policy a 
              little more bearable.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Get Someone Else To Read It For You</h3>

            <p>
              I'm not the only person talking about data privacy online! One solid 
              place to start is to search “[service] data privacy” and see what's 
              been in the news. A couple of other good places to look are:
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4><a href="https://tosdr.org/">ToS;DR</a></h4>
            <p>
              Stands for Terms of Serice; Didn't Read. 
              An <em>incredibly</em> comprehensive resource that also allows contributions 
              from the anyone with an account. Each service on the site is given a grade from A to E (or N/A), 
              as well as summarising the key points from the given Terms and Privacy policies.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4><a href="https://privacy.commonsense.org/evaluations/1">Common Sense Privacy Program</a></h4>
            <p>
              The Common Sense Privacy Program is a US-based non-profit organisation 
              that reviews various apps, scoring each out of 100%. It's not 
              perfect - there are instances where “This evaluation did not assess 
              whether this product collects geolocation data” or similar - but it 
              provides a simple to read overview of what a given privacy policy 
              says. 
              <br><br>
              It's also aimed at educators and parents, so there are sections 
              regarding whether the service is intended for schools or under-13s 
              which can affect the overall score whilst realistically speaking not 
              affecting you, the person reading this (unless you happen to be a 
              teacher, in which case hi, or under 13, in which case please don't spend 
              all your time on the internet there are better things to do promise).
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/">*Privacy Not Included</a></h4>
            <p>
              Mozilla is another non-profit, and also the group who made the 
              Firefox browser (which you should switch to if you use Google Chrome 
              or Microsoft Edge but that's another topic for another day).
              <br><br>
              It has reviews for a whole range of services, from Amazon Ring 
              cameras to Zoom to Pray.com, and splits their review into three 
              main sections: privacy (does it have camera access, what data does 
              it collect, is the policy user-friendly etc); security (is it 
              encrypted, does it encourage the use of a strong password); and AI 
              (if it's there, what decision does it made and how transparent about 
              its use is the service).
              <br><br>
              As a fun added bonus, it also provides the company's track record 
              (if known) of data protection.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Read The Damn Thing</h3>

            <p>
              Yeah, unfortunately the best way you've got of knowing what a 
              company is doing with your data is to read the document in which 
              they tell you what they're doing with your data.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Can you find it?</h4>
            <p>
              If a privacy policy isn't easy to find, if you've looked in all 
              the likely site locations and can't see it, if you find an error 
              when you should find a pdf… those are red flags!
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>How long is it?</h4>
            <p>
              There's no easy "your privacy policy should be exactly within this 
              specified range of pages", but documents that are both incredibly 
              short or incredibly long should be treated with suspicion.
              <br><br>
              Something that's one page long and contains lots of phrases to the 
              effect of "...and your data may be used for other purposes" is 
              something that very deliberately isn't telling you important 
              information about what, exactly, they're doing to your data.
              <br><br>
              On the other end of the scale, a document that's fifteen pages long 
              in size 9 font is almost certainly using the fact that nobody wants 
              to go through all that to hide that they went down the Yellow Pages 
              and sold your data to anyone who picked up the phone.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Do You Know Your Rights?</h4>
            <p>
              If you're a resident in the UK or EU, you have the right to access 
              data held about you, the right to have this forgotten, and the right 
              to not have your data used for marketing purposes (this is a 
              non-exhaustive list - you have other rights too).
              <br><br>
              A service processing data about you, then, should have provisions in 
              their privacy policy talking about this, and if it doesn't, that's a 
              red flag! Sometimes this is built into the policy as a whole, 
              benefiting everybody! Sometimes there is a separate clause (or even 
              an entirely differently policy) for people in these areas, in which 
              case, fuck the rest of you I guess?
            </p>

              <p>
                Other places may also have specific data protection regulations 
                that a service operating in that area should take into account. 
                For example,  both Australia the state of California in the USA 
                definitely do, and you should check if where you live does too.

            <h4>Ctrl+F</h4>
            <p>
              Everyone loves a good Find In Page. An incomplete list of phrases to 
              watch out for are:
              <ul>

                <li>
                  "Sell"
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    And if that has no results, a company might still share your data with 
                    “partner”s, “affiliate”s, or “third parties”
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                  “Advertising”
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Is it targeted? Can you turn it off? What, data do they use to advertise 
                    to you, and who else is it passed to?
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                  "May"
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    And other such vague words. A company that may share info or may 
                    combine it with information collected from other sources is likely 
                    not revealing the full extent of what they do.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              </ul>
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Wake Up</h3>

            <p>
              Realise this was all a terrible dream. The Internet doesn't exist. 
              The concept of a "business" is alien to you. Solid land is a 
              faraway dream. You are <em>Climatius reticulatus</em>, a small type of spiny 
              shark who lived about 415 million years ago and life is good.
