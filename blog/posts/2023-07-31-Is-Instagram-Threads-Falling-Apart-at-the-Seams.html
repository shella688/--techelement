            <p>
                Now as you may have been able to guess from someone 
                who is a fan of personal privacy, I do not like Meta. 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">It's nearly always a red flag when a data scandal you 
                were involved in has its own Wikipedia page.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                So I'll admit, I <em>was</em> skeptical when Meta 
                announced it was launching their own rival to Twitter 
                known as Threads. In the interest of open-mindedness, 
                I decided to see how right (or wrong, on the off 
                chance hell has frozen over) this skepticism was.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>This isn't Meta's first copycat rodeo</h3>

            <p>
                See, Meta (well, this was still in the Facebook 
                days) tried something called Threads before. It 
                launched in 2019 and the aim was to let users send 
                or receive messages, photos, videos, and stories. It 
                was, in fact, a similar concept to the newest Threads, 
                but instead of trying to challenge Twitter, they were 
                hoping to compete with Snapchat. It got killed off 
                in December 2021, to little sadness.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Threads... 2!</h3>

            <p>
                Threads 2.0 launched on the 6th July 2023. By the 
                10th July, it had surpassed 100 million users. 
                All that just made it even funnier when, upon 
                finding it on the Google Play Store, I was met with:
            </p>

            <img class="ss" src="../../_assets/images/Threads/playStoreReview.jpg" alt="The Play Store page for Threads">

            <p>
                That is indeed 2.7 stars, based on 150 thousand 
                reviews left by some of the 50 million+ downloads. 
                The Apple App Store is slightly more positive, at 3.5 
                starts, which comes from 2.2 thousand reviews. Most 
                complaints from Android users revolve around the app 
                crashing or bugging when you try to do, well, more or 
                anything. Six of the ten reviews that Apple let me 
                read give it 3 stars, citing lack of features as the 
                main reason it could be improved (Threads only got a 
                chronological feed as of the 26th July).
                <br><br>
                Where the fun <em>really</em> starts is the data 
                safety section.
                <br><br>
                Apple lists:

                your identity! What other data? Well, I wish I knew.
                <br><br>
                Google has more detail. This much more, specifically:

                <b><em>Don't like that at all.</em></b>
                <br><br>
                I'd really recommend you have a look through it 
                yourself, to see what they use each piece of 
                information for, as well as what is optional to share 
                (eg, precise location), and what can't be turned off 
                (eg, approximate location).
                <br><br>
                Threads also isn't available in the EU, which, as 
                I mentioned <a href="https://techelement.neocities.org/blog/posts/2023-03-08-Privacy-Policy-Deep-Dive-With-Tumblr-Live">last time</a> 
                I talked about a service not available in the EU, 
                is somewhat of a red flag. Meta even confirmed it's 
                been blocking attempts to access the app through a VPN.

                    The CEO of Instagram said 
                </a>
                this was due to “complexities with complying with some of 
                the laws coming into effect next year”, though decided not 
                to mention which laws those might be. That being said, 
                he's probably talking about the Digital Markets Act 
                (DMA). This act will make it so that large online 
                platforms (such a Meta) cannot prevent consumers 
                linking up to businesses outside their platforms, 
                track users outside of the core platform service for 
                advertising purposes without consent of the user, or 
                treat services offered by the platform itself more 
                favourably in rankings vs similar services offered 
                by third parties (

                ).

                Not looking fantastic!

            <h3>Anything fun in the T&Cs?</h3>

            <p>
                Well, you need an Instagram account to make a 
                Threads one, this is a fact presented to you when 
                you try to sign up. What they <em>don't</em> mention 
                as clearly is the fact that you can't delete your 
                Threads account without also deleting your 
                Instagram one - the best you can do is simply 
                deactivate it, hiding it + any content from users but 
                still leaving the data on their servers.
            </p>

                Also the Meta headquarters is at 1 Meta Way, 
                California, USA, which is entirely irrelevant 
                to this article but annoys me in a way I cannot 
                quite put into words.</p>
            </div>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Conclusion?</h3>

            <p>
              It's funny that right at the start of writing this I said 
              the words "open-minded" alongside "Meta". If you came here 
              for unbiased <em>anything</em> then you took more than a few 
              wrong turns on the way. 
              <br><br>
              I am honest-to-god <em>baffled</em> as to how Threads got 
              this big this fast. I thought we had all agreed Twitter 
              was an online cesspool why did so many people jump ship 
              to the Twitter knockoff made by <em>Facebook</em> of all people. 
              Genuinely please if you have Threads explain me your thought process I 
              truly want to know.
            </p>
