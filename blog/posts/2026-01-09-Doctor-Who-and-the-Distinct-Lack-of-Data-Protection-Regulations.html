          asking "How are they using my personal data?" </h2>

        <p><br></p>
        <p> Doctor Who is a long-running British science-fiction series, with Gallifrey -
          the home of the Time Lords such as the main character the Doctor - a recurring planet in it.
          At
          no point in the show has any writer discussed what the data protection regulations are like there,
          presumably due to strange ideas about what counts as "engaging storytelling". </p>
        <p> Good job I'm here! </p>
        <br>
        <h3> What? </h3>
        <p> The Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 lays out how personal data must be collected
          and stored in order to protect people's privacy. It has seven principles: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Purpose limitation, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Data minimisation, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Accuracy, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Storage limitation, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Integrity and confidentiality, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Accountability </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> We are going to asses how good Time Lord society is at data protection by
          looking at the show and evaluating how well what we see complies with these principles (based on my own
          subjective judgement - I do this for fun, not with expert knowledge). A 5 is the most compliant and as such
          the
          best score, meaning a 1 is the worst. </p>


        <div class="box">
          As of June 2025, the Data Use and Access Act (DUUA) updated the DPA
          somewhat. The changes it introduces are being phased in between June 2025 and June 2026. I'm not really taking
          the DUUA into account - in the <a
            href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/what-we-do/legislation-we-cover/data-use-and-access-act-2025/the-data-use-and-access-act-2025-what-does-it-mean-for-organisations/">
            ICOs
            own words </a> the act
          "offer[s] you an opportunity to do things differently, rather than needing you to make specific changes to
          comply with the law."
        </div>

        <p> Unlike the <a
            href="https://techelement.neocities.org/blog/posts/2023-04-01-I-sat-down-and-counted-the-GDPR-violations-in-fiction-podcast-Red-Valley">
            last
            time I applied data protection laws to fictional media </a> , I'm not going to go through every single
          appearance of Gallifrey in all of
          Doctor Who ever because my time on this Earth is finite. Instead, I'm going to just look at the TV show: all of
          classic
          Doctor Who (1963-1989) and all of modern Doctor Who until the time of writing (2005-January 2026). We're also
          going to have a quick stop at the straight-to-TV film Doctor Who (1996), partly - but not solely - because I
          like it. </p>
        <p> This does mean I won't be covering anything Gallifrey or its government might do
          in any books, audio dramas, comics or games. Perhaps on the day that I get round to listening to the Gallifrey
          spin-off audio series I'll do a second part to this article. </p>
        <p>

        <div class="box">
          <p>
            If you <em>do</em> want to listen to some people experience every
            single depiction of Gallifrey in Doctor Who canon, then can I recommend the podcast <a
              href="https://gallifreypod.podbean.com/"> Gallifrey Ad Nauseam </a>?
          </p>
        </div>

        </p>
        <p> Let's go! </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h3> Lawfulness, fairness and transparency </h3>
        <p> Lawfulness means that personal data must be collected and used on a lawful basis
          (as defined by UK GDPR) and that nothing done with the data breaches other laws. Fairness means personal data
          cannot be used in a way detrimental, unexpected, or misleading to the people it's about. Transparency means
          the
          body collecting data must be open and honest from the start about how they will use personal data. </p>
        <p> Perhaps the most obvious example of the Time Lords collecting personal data is
          the Matrix and as such we'll be coming back to this one a lot. The Matrix is a vast construct, usually
          compared
          to a computer, that stores the memories of dead Time Lords [1] as well as pretty much everything single other
          thing the Time Lords know. This includes, but is by no means limited to: scientific data [2], weapon
          blueprints
          [3] and details about experiments done on children [4]. Arguments about the ethics of acquiring such data is
          beyond the scope of this article. </p>
        <p> Is this lawful? As of the time of writing, no regulations <em>actually
          </em>state that memories count as personal data, but I'm sure that's only due to a lack of imagination. From
          this point onwards, we're going to assume that they do, alongside anything remotely similar such as a digital
          recreation of a dead person, a digital recreation of a live person and <a
            href="https://tardis.wiki/wiki/Biodata">
            the DNA that stores your entire past and future </a> . </p>
        <p> At least one lawful basis must apply when processing personal data: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> The individual has given <strong>consent.</strong> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> The processing is necessary for a <strong>contract </strong>with the
              individual. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> You have a <strong>legal obligation </strong>to process the data.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> The is a <strong>vital interest </strong>in processing the data - ie,
              protecting someone's life </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> The processing is necessary for a <strong>task in the public
                interest</strong> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> The process is necessary for a <strong>legitimate
                interest</strong> </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p> We can assume that consent to be uploaded into the Matrix is given - when
          characters discuss it there's no sign that this is something people are forced<em> </em>into [1]. As an
          archive
          of "the lived history" of the Time Lords [4] another lawful basis may also apply: tasks in the public
          interest.
          Good start! </p>
        <p> Is this fair? We do see more than one instance [1] [5] [6] of data in the Matrix
          being used to attack people accessing it, because Doctor Who is science-fiction and we can do what we want.
          The
          question is "When Time Lords die and agree to their memories being processed and uploaded, would they
          reasonably
          expect this data to then be used as a weapon?" <a
            href="https://tardis.wiki/wiki/Cloister_Wraith#/media/File:Cloister_Wraith.jpg"> They don't really look
            like they do. </a> </p>
        <p> Is this transparent? This links to fairness - if data isn't being processed
          fairly then nobody is likely being open and honest about that fact. Whilst the existence of the Matrix and the
          data stored in it is a known fact [1], we only have to revisit the image above to see that reality of the
          Matrix
          isn't, perhaps, as easy and pleasant as advertised. And we started so well too… </p>
        <p> 3/5 </p>
        <img class="ss" src="../../_assets/images/DW-GDPR/graph1.png" alt="A radar chart showing one spoke for each data protection principle. The score for this principle (3) is shown">
        <p><br></p>
        <h3> Purpose limitation </h3>
        <p> For purpose limitation, anybody collecting personal data must be clear about
          their purposes for doing so from the start. This purpose must be recorded and given to the people data is
          collected from, and data cannot be used for a new purpose without consent (or an obligation under law). It
          will
          often go hand-in-hand with the first principle above. </p>
        <p> Cloister Wraiths guard one of the locations where the Matrix can be physically
          accessed [6]. To put a name to a face, they're <a
            href="https://tardis.wiki/wiki/Cloister_Wraith#/media/File:Cloister_Wraith.jpg"> those people </a> . Having
          already
          established that using someone's memories to create an eternally-roaming security guard is probably neither
          fair
          nor transparent, we can assume that the Gallifreyan government hasn't been fully clear when stating why they
          collect these memories. </p>
        <p> Whilst in the show we never learn explicitly that TARDISes - space/time machines
          created by the Time Lords - send data collected to the Matrix, I'm going to include one in-scope example to
          further demonstrate how little the Time Lords care for purpose limitation. A TARDIS is capable of collecting
          biometric data, which can then be used to open the Eye of Harmony at the centre of each machine. A human eye, to be specific. At no point is any human told why their biometric data is needed to do this
          (nor do they ever give their consent, but that's largely because it's the villain trying to open it). It's
          also
          unclear why a TARDIS is capable of processing this data at all, since opening an Eye of Harmony for too long
          can
          destroy the entire space-time continuum [7]. We haven't even <em>started </em>to discuss that biometrics for
          identification are special-category data and are subject to stronger protection laws. </p>
        <p> Not a win for purpose limitation. </p>
        <p> 1/5 </p>

        <p><br></p>
        <h3> Data minimisation </h3>
        <p> Data minimisation means that the data collected must be enough to fulfil the
          stated purpose of collection (adequate), has a link to that purpose (relevant) and is limited to what is
          necessary. </p>
        <p> It's a balance, especially when it comes to archiving information: a stated goal of the Matrix. On the one
          hand, I sitting here in the real world can say that uploading the whole person to that thing seems excessive.
          On
          the other hand, the data stored in the Matrix can be used to predict the future and warn of incoming disasters
          [6]. We never learn the exact details of <em>how </em>it does that - and so equally we can't say that the
          memories of these dead Time Lords are excessive or irrelevant data. On a third, science-fiction-y hand, if
          you're storing so much data that knowing it all would turn a person mad and/or fill them with enough rage
          regarding what's stored there to destroy your whole planet [8] [4], then once again we land on the side of
          "this
          is excessive amounts of data". </p>

        <p><br></p>
        <h3> Accuracy </h3>
        <p> Bodies collecting personal data must take reasonable steps to ensure that said
          data is neither incorrect nor misleading. It may have to be kept updated, or must be erased as soon as
          possible
          if found to be wrong. </p>
        <p> When the personal information belongs to a dead person, it probably isn't going
          to change much. What's more, with this being an archive and these memories a historical record, data
          inaccurate
          to the present day can be kept, so long as it's clearly shown to be historical. It's like how the 1921 UK
          census
          doesn't need to be updated to show where all those people live (or otherwise) in 2026. </p>
        <p> Taking reasonable steps to ensure personal data about living people is accurate
          is harder when your society uses time machines, but the Time Lords do actually do it. When a general on
          Gallifrey receives a call from the Doctor, he's dismayed that "all twelve of them" are calling. It's bad news
          for the General because that piece of data is incorrect: the Doctor has a new, thirteenth face [9]. This
          information has been corrected the next time this general talks to the Doctor, with him talking to the correct
          incarnation at the correct time [6]. </p>
        <p> The principle of accuracy is different to that of integrity and confidentiality
          - we're not discussing here inaccuracies brought about by unauthorised access to the Matrix. That's a good
          thing
          right now, because the Time Lords are doing well in this section. </p>

        <p><br></p>
        <h3> Storage limitation </h3>
        <p> Personal data cannot be held for longer than necessary, and the length of time
          it <em>is </em>held for must be justified. Bodies holding personal data should periodically review it and
          erase
          or anonymise it when no longer needed, and an individual has the right to request their data - if no longer
          needed - is deleted. Data can, however, be kept for longer periods of time when used for archiving in the
          public
          interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes. </p>
        <p> As an archive, personal data can be stored in the Matrix indefinitely. However,
          it starts getting thorny when this indefinitely-kept data is used to make decisions. The <a
            href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-protection-principles/a-guide-to-the-data-protection-principles/storage-limitation/">
            ICO
            website </a> states that data
          stored indefinitely for archival purposes must <em>only </em>be used for archival purposes - none of this
          "predicting the future using the memories of all our dead people" nonsense. </p>
        <p> At this point, you may be starting to ask if creating the Matrix was a good
          idea. I don't have an answer for that one. </p>

        <img class="ss" src="../../_assets/images/DW-GDPR/graph5.png" alt="A radar chart showing one spoke for each data protection principle. The score for this principle (2) has been added">
        <p><br></p>
        <h3> Integrity and confidentiality </h3>
        <p> There must be appropriate security measures in place to protect personal data
          held. </p>
        <p> Extracting data from the Matrix without permission amounts to something equal to
          treason on Gallifrey [10], but this threat of punishment by itself doesn't count as a security measure. The Cloister
          Wraiths,
          on the other hand, absolutely do, alongside authorisation measures such as a user having to wear one of two
          special silly hats [1] [3], or be granted access by a specific key holder [5]. </p>
        <p> Looking at that paragraph, the Matrix would appear well-protected. However, one
          thing that comes increasingly apparent is that <em>none of those measures do owt.</em> Doctor Who is
          positively
          crammed with people gaining unauthorised access to it [1] [4] [5] [6] [10]. There's not point having all these
          security measures when they don't work! </p>

        <p><br></p>
        <h3> Accountability </h3>
        <p> Or, <em>somebody</em> has to take responsibility for following the law. Since we
          never see in canon any actual data protection laws, we're going to have to make some assumptions based on how
          well the great and good of Gallifrey take responsibility and demonstrate compliance to their other laws.
        </p>
        <p> At one point, the Doctor is put on trial, initially for harmful interference [2]
          and later upgraded to genocide [11]. We learn that Gallifrey has a justice system based on jury trials, albeit
          a
          system that can be (apparently easily) hijacked by a future version of yourself who wants you sentenced to
          death
          [5]. In fact, the Doctor is the <em>only </em>character we ever see the Time Lords put on trial. Nobody in
          charge of the Matrix when data is lost from it is ever sanctioned, nobody accessing it without permission is
          ever tried even when they're caught and, for a whole planet, there is no specific office or person that
          manages
          it. If there's a problem with data protection, the best anyone can do is go tell the Government as a
          general body. That's not accountability, that's carrying on as usual and hoping nobody notices. </p>
        <p> 2/5. At least they have<em> </em>a justice system that <em>tries </em>to be
          fair. </p>

        <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> Whilst the Time Lords tend to collect personal data on a lawful basis, keep it
          up-to-date and use it in reasonable ways - if rather grand, science-fiction-y ones - they often collect far more
          than they need and don't bother explaining to the individuals involved the full reasons behind it.
          Existing security measures are rarely enough to protect this data and the is little system of oversight to
          ensure accountability and compliance. </p>
        <p> Maybe - just maybe - storing everything a species ever learnt over their
          millennia of existence, including all the memories of all their dead, in one ill-protected archive is a bad
          idea. </p>
