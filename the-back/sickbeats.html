            <p>
                Welcome to the Tech Element Radio Hour, where I talk about music that I like with the intention of 
                getting you to listen to it. For each, there's a link to the album on Bandcamp 
                (where possible), or Spotify otherwise.
                <br><br>
                Check back here periodically for more music!
            </p>

              <b>WHO:</b> LIFE, off their 2022 album <a href="https://lifebanduk.bandcamp.com/album/north-east-coastal-town">North East Coastal Town</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHAT:</b> Alternative. I'd hesitate to call them purely punk, but definitely punk-adjacent
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHY:</b> If you've never experienced the catharsis of shouting along to "<em>my imperfect body houses my imperfect mind!</em>" 
              then I don't know what I can say to you
              <br>

              <b>WHO:</b> The Mechanisms, from the album of their final concert, <a href="https://themechanisms.bandcamp.com/album/death-to-the-mechanisms">Death to the Mechanisms</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHAT:</b> A steampunk cabaret band who take classic fairytales and myths, set them in space, and make songs about them
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHY:</b> This is the only proper album (ie, not just a Youtube video) of a live performance, and I love the energy
              and how you can hear the audience singing along
              <br>

              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHAT:</b> Emo, but think more midwest emo than something like My Chemical Romance
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHY:</b> My emotional support Texas music maker with lyrics that make me want to lie on the floor
              <br>
