            <p>
                Welcome to the Tech Element Radio Hour, where I talk about music that I like with the intention of 
                getting you to listen to it. For each, there's a link to the album on Bandcamp 
                (where possible), or Spotify otherwise.
                <br><br>
                Check back here periodically for more music!
            </p>

                <b>WHO:</b>  Faith and the Muse, from the 1999 album <a href="https://faithandthemuse.bandcamp.com/album/evidence-of-heaven">Evidence of Heaven</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHAT:</b>  Mostly synth-heavy darkwave
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHY:</b>  My favourite song off one of my favourite albums. I'm nothing if not a sucker for songs in 3 time

              <b>WHO:</b> The March Violets, from the 2013 album <a href="https://marchviolets.bandcamp.com/album/made-glorious-2">Made Glorious</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHAT:</b> The band's first full album, after a series of EPs, singles, and compilations released mostly in the 1980s. Typically very drum-machine gothic-rock sound.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>WHY:</b> Disregard what I just said about drum machines. Dandelion King is something that sounds like 
              nothing else the March Violets have made. I love the beat and the echoing vocals

                <br>
                <b>WHAT:</b> Emo, but think more midwest emo than something like My Chemical Romance
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHY:</b> My emotional support Texas music maker with lyrics that make me want to lie on the floor

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHAT:</b> I can only assume this came about from a group of mates who looked at each other one day like "yeah, we <em>should</em> make that band!".
                 That sounds derogatory it isn't! I really like Scars of Juliet, I like their sound, I own this album on CD, but also they're the kind who 
                 seem to struggle to carry a tune in a bucket.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHY:</b> have you ever been at a party that you kinda really want to have a good time at but also you hate 
                every moment of it and know on a fundamental level that this is not your crowd? Yeah.

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHAT:</b> Alternative. I'd hesitate to call them purely punk on account of I don't really know my punk, but definitely punk-adjacent
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHY:</b> If you've never experienced the catharsis of shouting along to "<em>my imperfect body houses my imperfect mind!</em>" 
                then I don't know what I can say to you

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHAT:</b> A steampunk cabaret band who take classic fairytales and myths, set them in space, and make songs about them
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>WHY:</b> This is the only proper album (ie, not just a Youtube video) of a live performance, and I love the energy
